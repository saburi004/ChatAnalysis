Chat Analysis

Analyze your WhatsApp chat exports using powerful visualizations and member-specific insights.

🚀 Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of WhatsApp chat data.
Simply export your chat .txt file from WhatsApp and upload it — the system processes it and generates:

📈 Rich visualizations (messages over time, busiest days, most active hours, emoji usage, etc.)

👥 Member-wise analysis (messages count, media sharing, emojis, keywords, activity patterns)

🔍 Conversation insights (top words, sentiment trends, chat peaks)

📊 Clean dashboards for easy understanding
